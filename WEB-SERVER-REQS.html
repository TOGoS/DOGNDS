<h1>DOGNDS Simple Web Server Requirements</h1>

<h2>Level 1</h2>

<p>Implements a read-only HTTP URN resolver.</p>

<p>Must support the following types of requests:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>GET &lt;root&gt;N2R?&lt;URN&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>GET &lt;root&gt;raw/&lt;escaped URN&gt;/&lt;filename&gt;</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Where <code>&lt;root&gt;</code> is an HTTP URL ending with
a <code>/</code> and <code>&lt;URN&gt;</code> matches one of the following formats:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>urn:sha1:&lt;base32-encoded SHA-1 (32 chars)&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>urn:bitprint:&lt;base32-encoded SHA-1 (32 chars)&gt;.&lt;base32-encoded TigerTree (40 chars)&gt;</code></li>
</ul>

<p><code>urn:sha1:</code> and <code>urn:bitprint:</code> are de-facto standard URN schemes.</p>

<p>For the raw/ form, URNs should be escaped as URL components for use
in the HTTP URL so that they are treated as a single argument/path
segment by the web server.  i.e.</p>

<p><code> full HTTP URL = root URL + "raw/" + urlencode(URN) +
"/" + filename</code></p>

<p>Special URL characters that do not have special meaning at their
position in the HTTP URL, such as "<code>:</code>", should be left
unescaped.</p>

<p>Filenames are provided for convenience of users who are loading
resources into a web browser and may be used to help determine returned
content-type, but must not affect the actual content returned.</p>

<p>The N2R style request may be used by clients that do not care about
suggested names or formats and is based
on <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2169.txt">RFC 2169</a>.  In
this form, the URN is the entire query string, and must not be
escaped.  RFC 2169 also dictates the full path of the N2R resource to
be <code>/uri-res/N2R</code>, but this specification allows any
prefix.</p>

<p>Resolver-based links from the web to should use
the <code>raw/&lt;escaped URN&gt;/&lt;filename&gt;</code> form, and
should make some effort to use a single canonical URL (to benefit
caches).</p>

<h2>Indexes</h2>

<p>Things that every server should index:</p>

<ul>
<li>The resource with a given SHA-1 sum</li>
<li>all siginfo+commits with a given tag</li>
<li>all siginfo+commits signed by a given publicKey</li>
<li>all siginfo+commits with a given tag and signed by a given publicKey</li>
<li>the latest siginfo+commit with a given tag and given publicKey</li>
</ul>

<p>(siginfo+commit indicates a combination SignatureInfo and its signed data)</p>
