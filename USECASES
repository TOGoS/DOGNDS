== Syndication ==

Publisher creates data, creates commit, signs commit, pushes all new data to servers.

Consumer queries servers for latest commit with a given name signed by publisher,
downloads new data.


== forum ==

Users may submit messages to a forum.  Each message is signed by the user and
references whatever messages it is a response to.

The forum aggregates these messages and publishes an index, signed by the forum
manager.

Users download the index (using 'get last commit named <forum name> by
<forum manager>' method) and can verify the messages.
