Define multiple 'levels' of implementation and the technology required for each.

e.g.
  Level 000: a web site that can respond to http://.../N2R?<name> or
             http://.../<urn>/<name> requests for sha1/bitprint URNs
  Level 100: web site accepts data via POST
  Level 200: Site stores and verifies singature info passed via
             Content-Signature: headers and passes them back
             with related objects. 
  Level 300: Site indexes commits by tag and signer and can interpret
             active: URNs to query based on this.
