Write document with examples of some data and HTTP Content-Signature encoding.

Define multiple 'levels' of implementation and the technology required for each.

e.g.

  Level 1: a web site that can respond to http://.../N2R?<name> or
           http://.../<urn>/<name> requests for sha1/bitprint URNs
  Level 2: web site accepts data via POST
  Level 3: Site stores and verifies singature info passed via
           Content-Signature: headers and passes them back
           with related objects. 
  Level 3: Site indexes commits by tag and signer and can interpret
           active: URNs to query based on this.

Could use 1.01, etc. as labels for updated level specs.

Look into feasability of making signatures and encryption PGP-compatible.
