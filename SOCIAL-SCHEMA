== High-level object model ==

* Commits point to previous commits ('parent') and to a 'target' (just like ccouch)
* A Person can 'share' a bunch of things.
* The things can have metadata associated with them by the sharer, such as tags and descriptions.
* The things may not have been created by the person, and in those cases SHOULD have metadata indicating
  their source (though we can't enforce this in the data).
* When the things being shared are defined by RDF describing them, that RDF can also provide metadata.

Since a person's information and shared items could possibly comprise an enormous amount of data, only a subset that can be encoded into a few kilobytes should be used as their primary 'profile document'.  This document can contain <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#seeAlso> properties that link to larger collections.  Based on my interpretation of this property (as edefined at http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-rdf-schema-20000327/#s2.3.4), it should link to a documennt that gives more information about this person, rather than to an object directly representing this same person (this also makes more sense intuitively.  Linking to a document is like saying 'read about me here'; the alternative would be like pointing to another person and saying 'this is also me').
