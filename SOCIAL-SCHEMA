== High-level object model ==

* Commits point to previous commits ('parent') and to a 'target' (just like ccouch)
* A Person can 'share' a bunch of things.
* The things can have metadata associated with them by the sharer, such as tags and descriptions.
* The things may not have been created by the person, and in those cases SHOULD have metadata indicating
  their source (though we can't enforce this in the data).
* When the things being shared are defined by RDF describing them, that RDF can also provide metadata.
