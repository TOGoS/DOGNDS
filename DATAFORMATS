== DOGNDS Data Formats ==

  <Commit> objects are the same as used by ccouch.

== URIs ==

  urn:[tree:]{sha1|tiger}:<base32-encoded-hash>
  
    The blob having the specified [tree] hash.
  
  urn:bitprint:<base32-encoded-sha1>.<base32-encoded-tigertree>
  
    The blob having the specified SHA1 and Tiger-tree hashes.
  
  x-rdf-subject:<uri>

    Indicates 'the subject described by the resource at <uri>, interpreted as an RDF document'
    
    Philosophical note: When the target is an RDF+XML document, 'subject described by' is
    pretty clear, whereas you could use x-subject:<arbitrary resource> to reference, say,
    the subject of an MP3 file, which, is that the song?  Or the subject of the song?  Etc.
    
    RDF is particularly useful because we can explicitly define our x-rdf-subject: URIs
    as referencing the thing described by an RDF document and not have any ambiguities.
    Even something like JSON would be less suited to this kind of use - are you referencing
    the data structure described by the JSON, or some abstract concept that that data
    structure represents?

  x-latest-commit-signed-by:<key uri>
  
    The most recent commit object signed using the specified key.

== High-level object model ==

* Commits point to previous commits and to a 'target' (just like ccouch)
* A Person can 'share' a bunch of things.
* The things can have metadata associated with them by the sharer, such as tags and descriptions.
* The things may not have been created by the person, and in those cases SHOULD have metadata indicating
  their source (though we can't enforce this in the data).
* When the things being shared are defined by RDF describing them, that RDF can also provide metadata.

TODO: Update the PersonAccessor interface and remove or change the notion of 'links';
I'm thinking now that people won't share links, but they can share arbitrary resources
while associating metadata (which can be done at the RDF layer without separate 'link'
objects, though it may still be useful to have similar objects in the API to separate
provided-by-user metadata and provided-by-resource [meta]data).
